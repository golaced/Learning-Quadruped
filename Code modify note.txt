1. Data set change to:"Pitch, Roll, Action"
2. Read sensor 30ms 50 times for reading to stable
3. NN setting set to 3input, 1output 
4. Intend to change the system mechanism,
so the initial pulse width setting has changed 
5. Action set should change to delta pulse? Then how to avoid pulse exceed limit?

20151104
1. Add Pulse into state set
2. Set the action to be delta pulse:+100,+50,+0,-50,-100
3. add pulse limiter

1. Using s' to replace s in the minbSk calculation
2. Interval between capture state and action conduct is set to 600ms
3. Modified: Using scaled Q after running calculating response(SSNN).vi,
so cost can have effective influence.
4. Set max expoch to 600
Seems like first succseful learning is achieved!!!(weight:20151109_3 to -8)

1. decouple the initial weights from selection
2. set all vi in SSNN public access
3. cancel scaling output
4. use collected samples to get scaling factor instead random set
5. add reach desired state criteria to stop at initial collecting
Succesful learning achieved!!!(20151112_5 to 0)

1. Make actions limited when encounter boundary pulse with fuzzy boundary
