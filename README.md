# Learning-Quadruped
Train a four-legged robot to learn

# Description
● Build a robot which can learn to carry objects horizontal by using neural network, reinforcement learning and Kalman filter<br/>
● Learned successfully under arbitrary, coarse, and nonlinear settings<br/>
● Used only raw information of roll, pitch, servo pulse, and action decision to train the robot<br/>
● Took less than 3 minutes or equivalent 200 movements to learn a successful policy<br/>

# Configuration
● Algorithm: Neural-Fitted-Q Iteration method, Rprop method, Linear Kalman filter<br/>
● Hardware: Arduino control board, Accelerator, Gyrometer, 12 servo motors, Ultrasonic distance sensor, A four-legged robot mechanical set<br/>
● Programming language: LabVIEW, C/C++<br/>
